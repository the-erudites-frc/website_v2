            <p>
                The Erudites team welcomes you to join our team. We are a FRC team 
                that will run during the 2024-2025 season. There are three main 
                subteams in The Erudites: Hardware, Software, and Business. Once you 
                are admitted into a subteam, you will be under the supervision of 
                the team head. We encourage you to answer each question with your 
                best efforts. Before you submit your application, please be aware 
                that we require your full efforts and dedication to the team. Thank 
                you!

                <p>
                    Participating on an FRC team is a major time commitment, especially during build 
                    season (January - March) as we are only given eight weeks to design, build, and 
                    program our competition robot. As a member, your teammates will rely on you to do 
                    your part. By applying, you agree to this time commitment. Please note that 
                    schoolwork is not an excuse for poor commitment during the season. You will also 
                    be expected to attend in-person or online meetings in Stouffville. Additionally, 
                    there will be a fee of $150 per member. We kindly request this fee to cover our 
                    initial registration expenses. Rest assured, if we are successful with sponsorship 
                    funds, we will promptly reimburse you.This ensures that tournament Registration 
                    fees can be met and will allow the team to compete. If you cannot pay this fee, 
                    there are options available to help you, so upon acceptance to the team, you are 
                    encouraged to talk to the team's Co-Captains. This should not hold you back from 
                    applying! All team members are expected to volunteer at events our team will 
                    host/partner with for the community. It is embedded in our team values to spread 
                    our love for STEM with those around us. In our team, we really value honesty. 
                    If for any reason you can't get your work done in a week, just give us a heads-up. 
                    We understand that things can go off track sometimes, and it's totally fine to 
                    admit it. Just remember, honesty is key, so don't hesitate to let us know if things 
                    didn't go as planned. Feel free to contact TheEruditesfrc@gmail.com for financial 
                    support and other questions.
