                            Whether it be for university applications, scholarships, or resum√©s, 
                            having experience with FIRST can be incredibly helpful. It can show 
                            your dedication to STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and 
                            Mathematics) education.

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            With FIRST robotics you able to learn and devlop hard-skills you will 
                            be using in the future. For example, learning to CAD, program a robot, 
                            use tools for soldering and much more. 
                        </li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Aside from hard-skills, you would also be building your soft-skills 
                            like communication, interpersonal, critical-thinking, and problem-solving 
                            skills. While you work in your individual subteams to support the team as 
                            a whole, you learn to work with your teammates while building lasting 
                            bonds.
